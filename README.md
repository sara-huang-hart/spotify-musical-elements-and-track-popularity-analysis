# ðŸ“Œ Project Background  
In the age of digitalization, music streaming services have become a fundamental part of how listeners experience and engage with music. In 2023, Spotify had a global market share of 31.7% with over 350 million users worldwide. In this project, we tried to answer the question, "Can music be simplified to a formula? Specifically, are there certain musical elements, like song duration, significant factors in determining a track's overall success?". To answer this question, we looked at the Spotify [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjanchaudhari/spotify-dataset) posted on Kaggle.
